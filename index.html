        <p>
          Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days
          lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has
          gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long
          as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to
          avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like
          skills in chasing them.
        </p>
        <p>
          At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon
          suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on
          a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a
          ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.
        </p>

        <p>
          Loves barking up trees, running around on the lawn, and digging in the

        <h2>Juno</h2>

          width="400"
          alt="Black and brown dog asleep on his side"
        />
        <p>
          No one knows exactly what breed Juno is, but that makes him all the
          more special. He was adopted before he was one year old; despite this
          and his German shepherd-esque looks, he stayed close to the same size,
          hovering around 50 lbs into adulthood. At the weathered age of ten
          years old, Juno is dealing with hip problems, but manages to stay in
          good spirits.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of Juno’s favorite pastimes is finding the dirtiest puddle within
          a one-mile radius and making sure every inch of him makes contact with
          said puddle. If rolling around in dirt was an Olympic sport, Juno
          would have been the one that facilitated its inclusion into the
          Olympics.

        <p>
          Rocket (also named huihui) is a 6-month pomeranian puppy with big eyes
          and a small, black cute nose. Rocket is named rocket because he runs
          so fast and energetic all day without even having some rest. Rocket
          loves to carry his little toy walking around the house and jumping
          towards my bed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rocket is friendly to all human beings. He will be a little shy at
          first, but will ‘say hi’ to you after a few seconds. He is also
          friendly to dogs, especially the small breed, because the large size
          dogs are hard for him to smell lol. If you meet rocket, don’t hesitate
          to say hi to him!! He will be super happy the whole day.
