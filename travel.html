          Yellowstone is the first national park in the United States. It covers
          over 2.2 million acres, and provides an opportunity to see wildlife
          and explore geothermal areas. In fact, Yellowstone contains about half
          the world's active geysers.
        </p>
        <p>
          These unique opportunities also bring out a lot of bad decisions among
          the tourists. Every year visitors injure themselves or the wildlife by
          getting close to the animals. You can see examples of people making
          bad decisions by visiting
